# Creating a Proposal

This guide provides an example on how to create software upgrade proposals on Evmos. To avoid mistakes I recommend double checking every flag and creating the proposal locally first. Note, that if you submit the proposal over CLI, first confirm if the proposal [has been submitted or failed](https://app.evmos.org/governance) before trying again.
